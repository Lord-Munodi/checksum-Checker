# Checksum-Checker

A very basic WPF app to find the checksum of a file.
Currently only supports SHA1, SHA265 and MD5, as these are popular secure hashes. Note however that MD5 is vulnerable and should not relied on if malicious tampering is suspected.

More features will be added, while preserving the goal of a simple utility. If you'd like a feature, send me an email.
